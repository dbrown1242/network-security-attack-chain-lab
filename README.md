##### **Project Title:**

*Network Footprint Analysis \& Controlled Attack Simulation (Multi-VM Lab)*



##### **Overview:**

*Designed and implemented a multi-VM network security lab to simulate a controlled internal attack scenario and analyze network footprints across virtualized systems.*



*The lab demonstrates practical networking, traffic analysis, vulnerability assessment, and mitigation skills in an isolated environment.*



*The objective was to simulate the full security lifecycle:*



*Reconnaissance → Service Enumeration → Exploitation → Traffic Analysis → Detection → Mitigation*



*This project emphasizes real-world networking troubleshooting, packet analysis, and defensive monitoring practices.*

*This project utilizes:*



* *Kali Linux*
* *Metasploitable 2*
* *Ubuntu Server*
* *VirtualBox*
* *Wireshark*
* *Nmap*
* *Metasploit Framework*
* *Suricata*
* *Zeek*
